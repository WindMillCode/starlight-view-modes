## Where can I activate the different modes now?

If you look in the right sidebar (Table of contents) you can probably spot the `Modes` heading where different modes can be activated. If you find the usability kinda hard and not intuitive, please let me know [here](https://github.com/trueberryless/starlight-view-modes/discussions/2). If you think the placement is alright, let me also know about it [here](https://github.com/trueberryless/starlight-view-modes/discussions/2) because why not...

Currently only one mode is supported but stay tuned for more modes, like the `Presentation` mode for example.

## Compatibility with other Starlight plugins

### Starlight Image Zoom

[Hideoo](https://github.com/HiDeoo) has created a very nice [Starlight Plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/resources/plugins/) called [Starlight Image Zoom](https://starlight-image-zoom.vercel.app/). Our plugins are compatible, i.e. the user can zoom images in Zen mode.

Try going into Zen mode and clicking on this image:

![Ceramic mug on table](../../assets/demo/mug.jpg)

import ImageAttribution from "../../components/ImageAttribution.astro";

<ImageAttribution id="ceramic-mug-on-table-OmOvMdiaZZ0" name="Robert Shunev" username="rshunev" />
